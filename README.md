NCAA Basketball Ranking Site

### Setup ###

I have written a separate scraper app here: https://github.com/avoerman/ncaabb-scraper
All data right now comes from \app\data\rankings\alldata.json. I'm looking for a better way for the two apps to interact.

To run:

npm install

bower install

grunt serve
